# Class 02 - React Props and State

## Warm Up

## Code Review

Any volunteers??

Thanks Rexie!

## React Bootstrap

Bootstap - library of css stylings, takes care of initial look and feel.

- 3rd party library, we are required to install.
- use npm to install `npm install react-bootstrap`.
  - installs a bunch of prestyled react components.
  - `import Button from 'react-bootstrap`

Installation:

1. cd into a react project directory.
1. `npm install bootstrap react-bootstrap`
1. Import bootstrap css file into React application

- `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';`

1. Now you can import bootstrap components in your React App!

## React Component Fundamentals Props and State

Both terms refer to data values that the React Library really cares about.

Props: Values passed in from one component to another(from a parent to a child component). Think of these values as inputs to function or class / constructor.

State: Values that remain internal to a component.  Should be thought of as data that stays in a component and only that component should care about it.
